Introduction
============

The purpose of this package is to provide advanced file and image
widgets for use in Plone.

This is mostly an experimental package right now and meant to be
merged into Plone core, maybe if we're lucky 5.0 or in 5.1.

Additionally, this has a purpose of providing decent file and image
widgets for mosiac.

All the being said, please don't use this in production.
